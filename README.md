# ElectronicsProjectTemplate
> Repository Template for Electronics Projects created with KiCad

This template should be used for any PCB projects being created with KiCad.

After creating your respository, you should also create a directory called `generated` - any output files from KiCad e.g. BoMs, Gerber files, etc. should be placed into this directory, to ensure they are not committed to GitHub.
